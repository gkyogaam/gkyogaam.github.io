## What is Quantum Healing, Quantum Touch?

"He who is not shocked by quantum theory has not understood it." 

– Niels Bohr, physicist

### Preface

First of all, I would like to recommend to your attention the findings of two internationally renowned scientists, which are related to the adoption of "revolutionary" new procedures, here:

According to János Selye, a revolutionary new scientific discovery is revolutionary precisely because it contradicts the previous scientific understanding that everyone believes to be true

According to Max Planck, every revolutionary new scientific discovery will make its way sooner or later, you just have to wait until the generation that is unable to absorb the new ideas dies out

### A short preview of Quantum Healing

One of the newest and most hopeful areas of alternative medicine is quantum healing, which has already helped thousands of people internationally. Nevertheless, representatives of science view the results with suspicion, as the current materialistic worldview does not always recognize the principles on which alternative remedies work.

Matter is nothing more than a broad and complex wave band consisting of standing waves. These waves also exist as long as we feed them with energy. The waveband range of the material is from 1014 to 1026 vibrations/sec (frequency). According to the laws of logic, there must be a Central Source, even if our current knowledge and level of consciousness does not explain the origin of this source.

"With the spread of materialism, people have lost their faith in the meaning of life, they do not recognize its meaning. In doing so, they were forced into a life-long escape from death.People believe they are bodies, they have lost contact with their Self, their soul, and have closed the way to it.

All matter is created and exists only by a certain force, which causes the atomic particles to vibrate and holds it together as the tiniest solar system of the atom. but since neither an intelligent nor an eternal force exists in space, we must suppose that behind this force there exists an intelligent spirit.” Max Planck

This point of view can be considered untenable for two reasons.

One is that nowadays the right to exist of alternative healing is unquestionable, since thousands of documented cases of its effectiveness are known.

The other reason is that the scientific theory that provides the basis for the use of non-material realities in healing has already been created. "Consciousness-based science", as Professor Amit Goswami, an internationally renowned physics professor, calls this new approach. A practical application of this new worldview is quantum healing.

According to modern physics, the basic unit of mass, matter and energy is the quantum, which is 100 million times smaller than the atom. There is no essential difference between a particle and energy. The quantum therefore consists of practically invisible vibrations.

According to Dr. Deepak Chopra, the quantum mechanical body is the basis of everything we are, that is, thoughts, emotions, cells, organs. Our bodies emit invisible vibrations that are picked up by others and vice versa. In the special world of quanta, everything is organized into a perfect unity. These relationships form the basis of the entire physiology, the functioning of the organs, our thinking, our feelings.  

Without this hidden physiology, there would be no visible physiology, and we could not have made it more than a bunch of molecules thrown on top of each other.  I will give an example of mutual influence.

Dr Dean Ornish in the coronary arteries of 40 advanced heart patients  
the reduction of sclerotic deposits occurring as a result of meditation 
pointed out. Previously, official medicine did not recognize that a
the heart disease process is reversible. Ornish says that what
built up in our body can also be broken down. We must say that
there must be a specific biological operating in biological systems 
for energy. This energy controls the functioning of the living being.

We don't know, we just think that our thoughts, feelings and emotions, as well as meditation, exert their effect primarily on a quantum level and they influence the physical bodily processes, since the physical body also consists of quantum energy. 
The new physical research proves that the mechanistic materialist thinking that has been in force for the past 300 years has been overthrown, which only accepts matter that can be directly measured by physical means as existing, and only examines the material's perceptible properties and interactions.

The latest physical research proves that the universe consists not only of matter, but also of energy states, from which different materials and even living organisms are the wave densities of this energy state. Every single substance and every living thing is closely connected with each other.

The scientific explanation of the phenomenon was given by prof. We can get to know him from the works of Dr László Ervin 

Prof. Dr. László, Ervin: The Creative Cosmos Flooris Books Edingburgh, 1993

The definition of quantum healing was perhaps best defined by Deepak Chopra, the world-famous doctor and author, when he wrote:
"Quantum healing is the ability of one form of consciousness (the mind) to spontaneously correct errors in another form of consciousness (the body)."
To put it even more succinctly, he writes:
“If a shorter definition were required, I would simply say that quantum healing creates peace.”   

Of course, the quotations may require some explanation, since the famous author uses concepts - consciousness, awareness, mind, peace - which can even cause misunderstandings, since each of them is a term that can be associated with multiple meanings...however, the situation is that this, with almost everything it is so. Even though we read and learn a text that is one and the same, everything in the world has a unique meaning for each and every person. After all, we are all different. We are conditioned differently, we are affected by different influences, completely unique influences...and that is beautiful.

Back to science for a few more thoughts.

You have about 100 trillion (15 zeros after the 1!) cells working non-stop to keep you alive. You control the work of all cells (?) You control them through your thoughts, feelings, acquired habits, beliefs... (through it yes... But how do you control it, what, where does this energy come from?)

The next question can be, how can a living being decide to start any of its processes?
A living being's decision is not independent due to history and natural laws. The decision can also initiate physical processes, but for this it must utilize quantum processes. However, physics does not make full use of quantum processes, so a quantum indeterminacy remains, which life uses for its own purposes. So what physics leaves free, biology can utilize. With their feelings, our cells move the constituent parts of the body, but also their own constituent parts. Experiments proved that feelings and thoughts are capable of controlling material physical processes (Moran Cerf's article published in the journal Nature in 2010.

### What is Quantum anyway?

### Quantum theory

The Newtonian world view was shaken by the quantum theory. The materialistic, dehumanized world was replaced by the evidence of immaterial energy. The solid material world becomes immaterial at the subatomic level in the light of quantum theory.
At the current level of our knowledge, the so-called strings and the loops they form can be considered, the identity of which is determined by their number of vibrations and their vibration frequency. In the world presented to us by string theory, there is no difference between matter and energy. Instead of 4 dimensions, the theory makes the number of dimensions in which strings exist simultaneously between 7 and 11. Strings do not work according to Einstein's speed laws, but exceed them. Parallel Universes gain probability and contact between worlds is also possible at the level of strings (Pearl 2009, Dienes 2010, Héjas 2010)

We banished from nature everything that is not measurable, non-numerical and objective. With this, quality, soul, spirit, conscience, and responsibility were displaced from the scope of scientific concepts (Hamvas 1988).
It seems that if the scientist searches for the particle, subatomic matter obediently behaves as a particle, and if he searches for it as a wave, it appears as a wave. This is the next indication that the human mind is able to influence the "something" from which the material world is made. 

**Brilliant!**

French researchers led by Alain Aspect conducted an interesting experiment. They removed one of the electrons from an electron pair and noticed that even if the electrons are thousands of kilometers apart, they know about each other, they communicate with each other, and the communication is instantaneous, i.e. at multiples of the speed of light.
It was Einstein who stated that the speed of light in the universe is the maximum, but no one has ever been able to prove this. Moreover, during more or less secret experiments carried out either in the USA or in the territory of the former Soviet Union, it always turned out that telepathy, or thought transfer, is an instantaneous flow of information compared to the speed of light, i.e. multiple times the speed of light.

### And what is Quantum Physics anyway?

The name Quantum comes from the observation that certain physical properties change per unit quantity (Latin: quantum), rather than in a continuous (analogous) way.

The emergence of quantum physics fundamentally shook the theoretical model that was developed over hundreds of years and is called objective science. Human perception has reached the subatomic level. Different laws prevail in these dimensions than in the realm of reality that can be observed with human senses. We must realize that the laws that govern the quantum world determine everyday life.

Well, knowing everything, you can do two things:

one is that you bury your head in the sand and deny that there can be "anything" beyond matter, or

you learn to use new insights to your own advantage. 

Understanding and applying the change of perspective is the most important thing. It is worth thinking about the following few principles and being open to them.

The basis of existence is Consciousness, not matter and not energy. Consciousness creates the material world.

Non-local relations: This is a mutual connection between all Exists (things, objects, living beings, nature, the Universe, etc.). However, the elementary particles are capable of immediate communication with each other after they have interacted with each other and become correlated through quantum non-locality. All this was confirmed by Alain Aspect and his colleagues already in 1982 under proven, verifiable laboratory conditions (with the help of a pair of photons). Many physicists who adhere to materialistic principles refuse to acknowledge this.

Thought sign - I would like to note here that it is also worth thinking about the fact that discoveries were always made by people who did not stick to previously created dogmas, but were open to new discoveries.The question here is whether because you were told or taught something, even though you have no real information or experience of your own, you accepted it unconditionally, you keep it as your own and you do not dispute it, you even defend this information and beliefs, or you are open to accepting the new, and if you ask your heart - which we now know that the "heart" informs the brain and not the other way around (this will be discussed further below) - whether you are willing to listen or can you even hear the voice of your heart? - Thought mark closed

The discontinuous movement. The change is not continuous, but occurs in stages, with so-called quantum leaps. This applies not only to the components of atoms, but can also be recognized in the manifested World, and even in your own personality.

Two brilliant Hungarian scientists: the world-famous mathematician János Neumann and the Nobel laureate physicist Jenő Wigner. They were the first to raise it and identified consciousness as the force that transforms the possibilities that exist in the quantum world into actual reality.

A non-materially based relationship system is assumed to exist. And for this there must be a field that connects everything to everything. Only one such mediating medium was known: consciousness itself. They stated that there are endless possibilities in the quantum field for consciousness to choose from and to appear as material reality (experienced).

Based on the material principle, however, Consciousness was considered as an individual part of the brain, the result. 

According to the materialist view, everything that exists is made of or belongs to matter 
is created as an interaction. Thus, of course, thinking and that 
emotions are also the function of a specially developed substance (the brain). 
results.. Even neurology views consciousness as such 
to the by-product of brain processes, which the substance, called up 
directed or bottom-up causal chain generates this causal 
model can be formulated in the language of quantum physics as follows.
The possible movements of elementary particles create atoms.
Those are the molecules, from which the cells are formed, and the cells form them
the brain. 
Rather, the brain perceives what is in the quantum space as a detector 
information that our own vibration level, our own waves 
are created. The way we feel. If you like that 
our emotions, which are, however, changes in brain states as a by-product 
are created. All this starts from Consciousness and not from the brain. Important! 
Consciousness is not the same as thought.
From this point of view, then, Consciousness is the totality of possibilities, which 
also called a probability wave. 
I wonder how a wave of probability can crush you 
to transform another probability wave is the observation or 
through interaction? Connecting two probabilities is never possible 
leads to a specific event, but to a higher probability. 

Quantum physics states that everything in the universe consists of the same matter, namely energy, electromagnetic vibrations. be it for example an object, feeling, sound or thought, but even ourselves. Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that studies phenomena at nanoscopic scales; and accepts the material that can be directly measured with these as existing and merely examines the perceptible properties and interactions of the material.

The vibrations of our thoughts affect both our bodies and our emotions. they affect our well-being and behavior. If our thoughts are negative, then negative effects and vibrations come to us. Of course, all of this does not happen the other way around, otherwise, if our thoughts are positive, such vibrations and their effects will affect us.

If someone realizes this and becomes aware of all this, he can radically change and improve his well-being, health and environment, which his thoughts also affect. If your thoughts are positive, your environment will also respond positively to everything.

Through his thoughts, he is able to create and change things in his environment. Thoughts, on the other hand, can be controlled by Consciousness, if they do not just arise by themselves, from circulation and vibration. If your worldview is negative, you can expect negative events. And with a positive worldview, you can build a positive world for yourself, around yourself with Consciousness.

If our thoughts were the product of our brains, we would have to find the electromagnetic waves with the help of our instruments in the interval between the upper limit of radio waves and gamma radiation.

The EEG records the electromagnetic waves of our brain, but it is not possible to read who is thinking what.

With lie detectors, they can't draw conclusions based on brain waves, but heart waves are informal, even though it doesn't help with specifics either.


### The role of Consciousness in the quantum world

Consciousness has played a key role in the interpretation of quantum physics.  The question of the inner world became more important than the outer one, since no meaningful answer can be given to the questions of the outer world without the inner one.The most important question is what is consciousness?

The relationship between consciousness and quantum mechanics remains unanswered. Many scientists (Heisenberg, Pauli, Bohr, Schrödinger, Sir James Jeans) turned to the mystical world in search of answers, since without consciousness reality cannot be explained.

Science based on consciousness ("science based on consciousness") can not only be applied to a specific science, but can serve as the basis of the entire scientific approach. The essence of this new worldview can be summed up in one sentence: The basis of existence is Consciousness, it connects quantum physics with psychology, religion, and mysticism. This point of view can create the integration of religion and science, eliminating the centuries-old separation.

The world-famous mathematician János Neumann and the Nobel laureate physicist Jenő Wigner were the first to put forward the assumption that identified consciousness as a force that transforms the possibilities existing in the quantum world into actual reality.

Jenő Wigner, the Nobel prize-winning physicist, asked this question decades ago in his memoirs. He had a reason for it, since he was one of those scientists (there were and still are not many) who were honest and open enough to admit: with the birth of quantum physics, something changed forever in science. The connections and regularities that humanity has come to know through the discovery of the quantum world give us the opportunity to radically transform our way of thinking about the understanding and relationship between ourselves and the world. To do this, one would only have to go beyond some scientific dogmas and change the basic approach.

The information field of the Quantum, or as it is scientifically called 

### Morphic field

Professor Sheldrake, 2005, published in The Ecologist 
in his abstract he wrote about a special investigation, about how 
it is possible that a large number of animals occurred in Asia in 2004 
during a tsunami, how could he escape without human intervention. 
Indeed, the elephants of Sumatra and Sri Lanka long before the sea 
the earthquake below would have started at all, they started trumpeting together, 
then they all marched to the higher grounds. The buffaloes are a 
they went up the mountain from the beach, followed by the villagers in bewilderment, 
it saved their lives. Long before the event, the dogs escaped, 
goats, buffaloes and escaped to the high altitude areas, where they no longer 
the water went out. The tribal groups living in the Andaman Islands noticed it 
tension of animals, they followed them, thus surviving the disaster. 
Animals sense the occurrence of misfortunes and indicate this as well 
to each other.

In the case of dogs left at home, it is shocking 
82 times out of 96 times, the dog sensed when its owner was there 
will arrive. He jumped up unexpectedly and signaled that the owner was coming. 
In the course of further testing, with a remote observation for the next 
it became clear: the owner had traveled further away, staying with him and the dog at home 
a camera was also installed. At a freely chosen time, the farmer 
he stated that he was going home now. 11 seconds after declaring a 
dog at home ran to the door to wait for his owner. 
In the field of morphic resonance, Sheldrake is significant in many cases 
he was able to show a very distant human-to-human connection and 
in the field of human-animal relations 

In connection with another observation, cats sensed their owners in advance 
your phone call. For example, when the University of California is famous 
the phone rings at his professor's house, his wife knows he has a husband a 
on the other side of the line, because Whiskins, the silver tabby cat, rushes a 
phone and puts his paw on the device.
"Many times he managed to hang up the phone, and then with satisfaction 
she meowed when it was clear that my husband was on the other end of the line 
at the end," said the wife. "If someone else calls, Whiskins 
he doesn't even notice it." 
The cat reacts even if it is from Africa or South America 
calls home.

And finally

Prof Dr Jung personally observed spontaneous synchronic phenomena, 
and tried to discover some regularity in them. 
As an example of such a spontaneous phenomenon, he mentions when a female patient
during his dream analysis, he suddenly mentioned the sacred scarab beetle 
they heard a tap on the windowpane as one flew at them from outside
a true scarab beetle, or at least the European version.

Another example from Dr. Jung is about when once in a heated argument
mixed with Freud - and precisely with the interpretation of synchronicity
relationship - and tempers ran high, suddenly with a big bang
the thick oak door of the closet in the room split open.
Jung observed that they are people who live far from each other and have different destinies 
in his dreams, there are regularly those with a strong emotional charge,
similar images, situations, symbols that are not
they may belong to the personal unconscious, as these patients
they have no history whatsoever in their personal lives.
These archetypes and symbols regularly occur far from each other 
in the culture, folk art, superstitions, myths, 
in fairy tales and folk songs.

Regarding farsightedness, Harold Putthoff and Russel Targ, -
two physicists from the Stanford Research Institute - conducted successful experiments. 
(Putthoff & Targ: Mind-Reach, New York, Delacorte Press, 1977)

The professor supports the theory of the morphic field in parallel
among his researches is not only telepathy, but also, for example 
proof of the following areas based on reliable research, 
according to which:

can no longer be measured in patients returning from the state of clinical death
phenomena experienced during brain waves are conscious and related to the 
with a morphogenetic field.

The events of birth and death can be traced back to the morphic fields,
properties of morphic fields - that is, that everything is related to everything else
at the level of consciousness and senses - everything was considered paranormal until now
can give an answer to a phenomenon.
In several readings, the professor indicated that science is not yet open enough to accept this completely new approach to the world around us due to its dogmatic principles. Several journals dealing with new scientific trends directly believe that Sheldrake's work is nothing more than one of H. P. Blavatsky's worldview-changing scientists predicted in her 1888 publication titled The Secret Teaching. 
 
 
 
I have "collected" all of this here because you may not have heard of Quantum Theory and Quantum Physics yet, and it may be an interesting wake-up call for you to wake up and discover your Consciousness, which has been there all along, was inside you, around you and is just waiting for you. to notice.
 
Thanks to Bence Zsoldos, who did the actual collecting work.

## Quantum touch therapy

So if you want to heal in Kvantum space, with my help, support, and accompaniment, feel free to contact me! Make an appointment and experience the miracle of healing for yourself. 

Quantum therapy does not affect everyone in the same way, just as drugs and other treatments do not affect us in the same way. Some people leave immediately cured, some people need several treatments, and it may also happen that the treatment will not seem to have an effect on you, or other healing processes will start in you, the effects of which you may only experience later. 

The treatment begins with a short conversation, 15-20 minutes, only within your own comfort zone. then the essential therapy takes place for about 15-20-30 minutes, in a relaxed state, standing, sitting or lying down. In any case, we end the process with a 10-15 minute relaxation, which can be just a conversation, but it can be an actual relaxation, perhaps with the addition of a sound bowl, so that the healing processes can calm down and take root. If you feel that this would be the path to recovery for you, please come to the treatment so that you don't have to rush anywhere that day and if possible only eat light meals that day. Do not eat anything an hour before the treatment, but your liquid intake (clean water) should be plentiful.

## Book an appointment:

[gkyogaam@gmail.com](mailto:gkyogaam@gmail.com)

[+36 20 566 9665](tel:+36205669665)

If you still cannot come to the pre-arranged time, you can cancel 24 hours before. If you do not cancel or cancel the appointment without reason within 12 hours, the treatment fee will be invoiced. Thank you for your understanding!

Quantum treatment fee: HUF 13,000 / session

If you suffer from a serious mental disorder, you are prohibited from participating in the treatment. It is forbidden to participate in the treatment while in an alcoholic state, under the influence of drugs, narcotics, or other mind-altering agents or sedatives.

I obtained a certified quantum touch qualification on April 21, 2024, 

By Dr. Judit Povall, the official Quantum Touch instructor, and I was officially registered in the list of the Quantum-Touch Society.

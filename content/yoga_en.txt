## More about yoga



### What is yoga? 

The word "yoga" is of Sanskrit origin and means: connection, union. 

It is a form of ancient Eastern philosophies that developed in India, the cradle of Hinduism.

Yoga exercises exert their effect in their entirety, creating a balance of body, spirit, consciousness and soul. In this way, yoga helps to solve and overcome everyday trials, problems and worries. With yoga, we get closer to knowing ourselves, to a higher understanding of the meaning of our lives and our relationship with the Source, that is, with God.

"...if someone develops through yoga and meditation, over time he will find all knowledge in the Self, in the heart" Bhagavad-gita 4.38 translated by Attila Bakos


### What is mobility or mobility yoga?

Mobility yoga is a type of yoga that focuses on improving range of motion and relieving stiffness and pain associated with conditions such as arthritis and joint stiffness.  Maintaining mobility is of primary importance because it allows people to remain independent for longer, i.e. not needing assistance and maintain a good quality of life as they age. On the other hand, limited mobility can often lead to other types of "disability". That's why I show several practical routines in classes, due to lack of time, mostly in private lessons.

Those who are looking for exercises to improve their mobility may not know the difference between mobility yoga and "normal" yoga. The main purpose of yoga (according to Natalie Nevins, DO) is to build strength, awareness, and harmony in both mind and body. The main goal of mobility yoga is to improve mobility and promote joint health by relieving tension. However, all physical exercises bring about the release of mental tensions and harmony. This is facilitated by breathing exercises before the start of the lessons and relaxation at the end of the lessons.

### Are mobility and flexibility the same thing?

We often associate yoga with flexibility. While it's true that many traditional yoga routines focus on improving flexibility, mobility is a different concept. If you're looking for a yoga class to improve mobility, be aware that it prioritizes range of motion over flexibility, although I try to mix mobility and flexibility exercises in my classes.

The main differences between mobility and flexibility (flexibility) are:

Flexibility focuses on the extension of the muscles and soft tissues that cross the joints, while mobility is related to the movement of the joint.

Flexibility is measured by how far a joint can move, while mobility refers to an individual's ability to initiate, control, and sustain movement.

Both flexibility and mobility are very important for the overall health of the body. However, patients with conditions that affect their mobility, such as limited ability to squat or walk, may prefer mobility exercises over flexibility. That is why I recommend a private class for those struggling with long-standing joint changes, where I tailor the exercises and expand the range of motion step by step, as a result of which the joint tension and thus the inflammation will decrease and, ultimately, may even disappear.


### Who is yoga mobility good for?

Mobility yoga can be extremely beneficial for people with chronic arthritis. People in different physical conditions can improve their current condition with regular exercise. Regular practice, as in most areas of life, can bring success here as well, which has an impact on other areas of life as well.
Ideally, all of your joints should have a good range of motion. In order to perform everyday movements easily, however, some joints need to remain particularly mobile:

These

The hips

The upper back section of the spine

The ankle

The wrist

The shoulder joints

If these joints are not mobile enough, you may have difficulty performing basic movements such as squatting or raising your arms overhead. Anyone with conditions affecting these joints should consider mobility exercises.


### Who else can benefit from mobility yoga?

Beyond those with certain joint problems, mobility yoga sessions can benefit in many ways, including:

People with arthritis, Parkinson's disease or MS (multiple sclerosis). For those who have undergone hip surgery or are about to undergo surgery, or to avoid it.In addition to improving range of motion, mobility yoga practice can also improve motion control and stability.

Elderly people who use different devices can also improve their mobility with safe, adapted exercises.

Athletes. Yoga can help reduce the risk of injury, improve balance and coordination, and prevent (especially in certain sports) constriction, stiffness, and loss of laxity.

I deal with athletes.

Office workers who sit at a desk for long periods of time may suffer from stiffness and may experience constant discomfort due to poor posture. Mobility exercises can help relieve tension and improve posture, reducing and ultimately eliminating pain.

I offer office yoga classes, also in office settings.

Elderly people. Good mobility can reduce the risk of falls. It can also help elderly people maintain their quality of life, as it allows them to escape from the four walls and continue their life activities and hobbies.

I like dealing with elderly people, I enjoy their company. Feel free to ask me, I'll even come to your house.

Also 

Anyone who wants to improve or maintain their body's well-being. This applies to people of all ages, fitness levels and physical abilities. Improving mobility can help improve well-being and prevent loss of mobility as you age.


### How does mobility yoga help?

Mobility yoga has many potential benefits. The benefits you experience may vary depending on the routine you follow, the frequency of your yoga practice, and any medical conditions you may have.

Safety note: If your health is critical and you are not sure how to start training, or you are worried about the effect of exercise / exercise, talk to your doctor or physiotherapist before you start training with me.

Improves mobility and balance 

Yoga can improve mobility if the exercises specifically target a problem area. If mobility is a priority, focus on mobility training, as regular yoga practice alone may not help.

Increases blood circulation

Mobilizing and stretching the muscles and connective tissues promotes blood circulation throughout the body. Fascia training also promotes mobility.

Improves sleep 

Yoga (including mobility yoga) focuses on techniques such as full, deep breathing, relaxation, and finding focus that can improve sleep.

Improves posture

Generally, if you are stronger and more flexible, your posture will automatically improve. If you attend a mobility yoga class, you can learn more conscious posture and breathing and how to improve and maintain it throughout the day.

Regular practice can make you calmer and more relaxed.

Yoga combines movement with mindfulness, reflection and breathing techniques to help you feel more relaxed.

It reduces muscle tension 

Stretching and training the muscles and fascia reduces tension, not just in a physical sense.


### What is Hatha Yoga?

Hatha yoga (Sanskrit: हठ योग) is a form of yoga. One of the most well-known styles of yoga, the name of which is made up of the words "ha" and "tha" and has a symbolic meaning: the word "ha" means Sun, and "tha" means Moon. Hatha yoga balances the Sun and Moon active and passive, solar and lunar, prana and apana energies in the body. It was originally a branch of Raja yoga, but today it forms an independent yoga system that strives to preserve physical and mental health. Its main purpose is to find and activate the chakras, one by one. This is how you try to bring kundalini, the dormant spiritual energy, to life.  Hatha Yoga is the Yoga of mastery over the body. In contrast to the main yoga trends, it does not aim at liberation and salvation, but at physical health and perfection, where one is in balance on a physical, emotional, mental and spiritual level. It became popular mainly in the West.

The explorers and experienced practitioners of the teachings of yoga knew the human body, every part of the body and its functioning well, so that the ways of sitting and postures consciously influence the body, affect certain organs or certain nerve centers.

Hatha Yoga mainly deals with this part of yoga.

This branch of yoga wants to control prana, the energy, through the body, that is, to remove the body as an obstacle and involve it in the flow of energy. This is a very obvious method, since we live in a body and our body prevents us from focusing mentally until we can submit it to our will. Hatha-Yoga is a gentle practical method and starts self-discipline where it really should start: with our body, with the mobilization and regulation of our physical structure.

It goes hand in hand with breathing control and prana control (pranayama), and the correct posture, the so-called asana, is inseparable from it. "Asana" literally means sitting posture. The postures associated with sitting postures are called mudras, but mudra is usually called asana together with the posture. There are a great many different sitting postures and postures known and each of them has its own meaning and purpose. Hatha-Yoga is very well developed system. It is based on a perfect knowledge of the body, although this knowledge grew from completely different roots than the anatomical knowledge of the West. It takes into account not only the parts of the dense body, its conduit networks, but also the fact that they are only mediators of dense matter, body, the condensing of the higher vibrational, light energy into the lower vibrational, dense energy), are tools of the spirit. to be excellently suited to perform all kinds of tasks, but to consciously control all external and internal parts of the body, overcome the inhibitions and limitations caused by the body, and thus be able to put the forces at the service of spiritual, higher-order goals. The indirect end goal of Hatha Yoga is spiritual.

I always combine mobility elements with Hatha elements, with rare exceptions. In hatha yoga, the poses are held for a long time accompanied by breathing, so the activity of mobility is relaxed in the hatha elements. :))


### What is Spinal Yoga?

Spinal yoga is a modern movement therapy. In these classes, we also perform yoga exercises, which start from the postures of hatha yoga and which help to restore the health of the physical body and the nervous system, and the flexibility of the spine.  Thus, the goal is prevention and aftercare.

In addition to improving posture, its physiological effects include strengthening, relaxing and stretching the muscles, helping to relieve stress, increasing physical and mental endurance, and helping to alleviate the negative physical effects of a sedentary lifestyle.

With the help of the series of exercises that can be easily performed and mastered by anyone, a joyful development can be experienced.

Pathological spinal changes that have already developed must be treated with the help of a specialist, yoga exercises are often helpful in such cases, but before you come to me, consult your doctor!

So again:

If you practice on your own outside of yoga classes, or if you do not inform about an existing problem or illness, I cannot take responsibility for possible injuries. 

Always treat your body with love, follow the principle of gradualness and never force your body into a pose or situation for which you are not yet ready! This way you can avoid injuries and unnecessary pain. Slowly, gradually, with regular practice, you will reach the desired state. Give yourself time, because all the time you spend on yourself will pay off. Never be impatient with yourself! Don't curse, don't hurt yourself, rather be proud of yourself, for every step you've taken, for all the time you've devoted to yourself, for all the attention you've paid to yourself.

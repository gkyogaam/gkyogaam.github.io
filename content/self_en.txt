### How does a consultation with me take place?

Self-awareness consultation is a relationship of trust. Of course, complete confidentiality is required. We have an exploratory conversation with the first shape. It is important that you come to the conversation so that you can really devote this time to yourself. You shouldn't have to rush anywhere, don't wait for an important phone call or message, because all that can hinder the joint work, but above all, so that you can actually focus on yourself.  The duration of the consultation is minimum 90, maximum 120 minutes. After the first meeting, it is good if two weeks pass so that what was said can settle down, and to feel whether we will be able to work together, whether trust can be established and the will on your part to change, since you are the main character here.

If you suffer from a serious mental disorder, unfortunately you cannot participate in a consultation with me. Such conditions require a clinical psychologist. Please see a specialist! It is forbidden to participate in the consultation while in an alcoholic state, under the influence of drugs, narcotics, or other mind-altering agents or sedatives. If you regularly experience such things, in this case too, seek a professional as soon as possible!

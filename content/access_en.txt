## Access Bars Therapy 

The Access Bars treatment is an effective and at the same time extremely simple way to change the fixed points of view, belief systems and behavior patterns stored in our body. This increases awareness and the possibility of conscious choice. Awareness helps us to ensure that our lives don't just happen to us, but that we take control ourselves.

With each treatment, we can get closer to the state when we were still enthusiastic little children open to everything and did not accept the limiting points of view and rules of this reality. The small child can be completely happy and does not hold back even when he is angry. Then all of this is gradually overridden by the rules of upbringing and environment. That's all that has changed in the world of those people who chose the Access Bars treatment. They realized that they don't have to accept the viewpoints of medical science, that they can no longer be helped. They took control into their own hands and overwrote it so that it could no longer be changed.They found the tool for all this and chose it. They realized that there is another choice and that life can be painless and joyful. The key here is choice. I myself am one of those people. I personally experienced the beneficial, resolving, liberating, healing and calming effect of Access Bars.

You can choose something completely different from what your parents taught you at school and you don't have to take other people's points of view into account. Everything is just an interesting point of view and you choose what works for you, what is true for you. Because you believe in yourself, you believe that you are in control.

When you receive Bars treatment, it is a bit like when you start the cleaning and defragmentation program on your computer's hard drive. The files that are no longer used and only junk are deleted and overwritten and new ones can be written in their place. You will know that you can and the more Access Bars treatments you receive, the more confident you become in your knowledge, the more you awaken to your Consciousness. As your awareness grows, you can be more present in your life without judgment.


### Access Bars treatment in practice

The treatment takes place lying on a massage bed, you lie comfortably dressed and covered with a soft blanket. At the same time, I touch certain points on your head, each of which is related to some area of ​​life, such as creating relationships, creativity, money, aging. Following the touches, you enter the theta state, in which the stored belief systems that no longer serve you become accessible, so they can be released. There are 32 Bars points on the Head, which store all your thoughts, ideas, belief systems, and emotions, which you have made your own at some stage of your life. Touching the Bars point corresponds to the "Restart" button. What is no longer needed is erased, giving way to the new, the rearrangement, but now under your control.

With each Bars treatment, you change or recreate your future. By running Barok, you can break down the walls built around you as a defense, removing the compulsion to build all your decisions based on past experiences. You can be open again like a small child, you can make free decisions without fear and without the burdens of the past. You regain your faith in yourself, in Life.

The Bars are 32 points on the head, touching which helps to remove the energies stored in your body that no longer serve you, thereby opening the way for changes to occur easily. This should be imagined in the way that, with the help of the Bars treatment, those ideas, thoughts, belief systems, patterns copied from others, which you carried with you from earlier and were stored in your energies, in your energy field, become bubbles and burst.

By gently touching the points, it is possible to dissolve and release old energies. Perhaps it can be compared to when you reinstall your computer and defragment your hard drive, and also delete all unnecessary or harmful files. You know from experience that your machine will thank you for this with faster, easier operation.

The same thing happens to you. Everything in your life becomes easier and smoother. The things you desire will easily appear in your life and your relationships may become more balanced. Peace, joy and lightness will be typical in all areas of your life. Studies prove that during the Bars treatment the brain waves change from beta to a deeper theta level and after one hour of treatment the brain is in a similar state as if you had been relaxing for several hours.

No two Access Bars treatments are the same. The smallest result you can achieve with a treatment is that you feel like you got a great head massage, the biggest result you can achieve is that your whole life will change. Situations that used to bother you will affect you much less and your general mood will be characterized by lightness and peace. You will become more confident and sleep more restfully, those annoying events that caused unpleasant moments will lose their significance.

Once you have received Bars treatment, your Bars will run from then on, the release of stuck points of view is continuous. Each new treatment increases the effect. The biggest changes can appear 3 weeks after Bars treatment.

The rule regarding the amount of treatments is that there is no rule. Any Bars treatment can be used without side effects.

How easy do you want your life to be? Most people choose to run their Bars once a week or once every two weeks. Treatments are scheduled on stressful days.

The Bars treatment can be given to anyone who wants and is willing to lie quietly during the treatment, who is ready for the treatment to change their entire life.

Children can also receive Bars

Some people are concerned about whether children or babies can receive the treatment. The good news is, of course it does.They are more receptive to these energies than adults, they have fewer perspectives on what is possible and what is impossible, and they easily accept changes. The processes are much faster with them. For babies, even a few minutes may be enough. Children also mature with significantly shorter treatment than adults and can learn to run the Bars very quickly. Children are much more willing to choose the bigger creatures and have much less perspective on whether they can show the world what they know.

Anyone can learn Access Bars treatment and anyone can apply this knowledge. It does not require any prior knowledge or experience. By the way, the same applies to Quantum Touch.

Bars was channeled in 1990 by Gary Douglas, the father of Access Consciousness. Before this knowledge did not exist in this form.

It can also be used in the case of the sick, the disabled, and the elderly.

It can even be used to improve the quality of life of the disabled and sick. There are many related experiences with both humans and animals. 

It can also be recommended for expectant mothers. During their pregnancy, expectant mothers who ran Barjaikat reported a more balanced pregnancy and an easier birth, and there were also those who managed to avoid caesarean section.

The Access Bars treatment usually lasts 60-90 minutes, but this can vary. Even a short treatment is much better than none at all.

Let go of your perspectives on the disease and you can heal

In many cases, Access Bars have been used in combination with other tools of Access Consciousness to cure diseases believed to be incurable, for which there was no medical explanation. It has already been used in the treatment of cancer, chronic fatigue, depression, bipolar disorder and borderline personality disorder.

Many people wonder how many treatments are needed for the change to heal. Unfortunately, this cannot be known in advance and mostly depends on the recipient. The disease and its related symptoms can disappear when you and your body are able to let go of all restrictions, ideas, points of view, belief systems, vows, emotions, feelings, judgments and decisions that keep this unwanted state in place. There are those who experience a dramatic change with a single treatment, while for others it takes several sessions.

Questions can make the process more efficient.

It is possible for the facilitation to take place in relation to a certain area during a treatment. The operator can help the process with questions and cleanings. The changes depend on the recipient's personality and how much change is still comfortable for him, what he is willing, i.e. able to choose.

The question often arises as to when Bars treatment is necessary. There is no right answer to this, any time you want to feel good. The majority strive for at least one treatment per week or two weeks, and this can be supplemented if you had a difficult day or something extraordinary happened to you.

It is most convenient to perform the treatments lying down, but a chair with an adjustable backrest can also serve the purpose.

I'll go to your house if it's convenient.

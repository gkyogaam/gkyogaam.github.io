### My encounter with yoga and that certain "more"
Many beliefs kept me away from yoga for many years, as I was raised as a Christian Catholic and in these circles, thanks to the influence of the "dark" ages, which continues to this day, there are many delusions and fears related to yoga and ancient sciences such as the science of astrology, or the philosophy of yoga, and not only as a philosophy, but also as a form of movement. 
Towards the end of 2011, my shoulders and shoulder blades started to malfunction, become inflamed, narrow, and the muscles began to stick. At that time, I had not played sports for 4 years and I worked a lot and slept little. By the spring of 2012, I could no longer sleep at night because of the pain, and my shoulders were "frozen". This is what it is called when the shoulder girdle loses its normal function. I couldn't even raise my arms horizontally. I completely collapsed mentally that, despite my young age, I was partially paralyzed. I had a long road ahead of me. The doctors gave up on me. They suggested surgery, but they said that my shoulder will never function normally again and that my spine is in a very bad condition, so I will probably end up in a wheelchair at a young age. But I didn't believe them. I looked for another way. After several months of spinal therapy treatment, physiotherapy and special massage, I came into contact with yoga in the fall of 2012. I started practicing yoga at the suggestion of my therapist and at the same time I came into contact with fascia training. Every day for a year, when I did yoga and rolled myself, I experienced pain and cried a lot. After two years of regular, daily practice, my shoulders returned to their original function and my spine began to slowly transform and change. My hip pain slowly disappeared. All this was the result of many years of regular practice and a complete change of lifestyle and diet. I also changed my shoes, because I also realized that the well-functioning movement and frame system starts from our feet, our soles, and now I almost exclusively wear "barefoot" footwear.

I originally graduated as a nurse at Batthyány Strattmann László High School and Vocational Health School. 
I started my life as a nurse. I worked in the neurosurgery department and in the neurosurgery ward at the National Traumatology Institute in Budapest. I met a lot, saw and experienced a lot in the hospital, not only in the neurosurgery department, as I had doctor mentors from whom I could learn a lot.
I left the health field and continued my studies in commerce, then gastronomy and then horticulture, but I knew that one day I would like to work as a healer. When I first came into contact with homeopathy, the healing effect of nutrition, then with yoga, fascial training, Ayurveda, Meditation, Transcendental Meditation, Access Bars therapy, Quantum therapy, and I experienced all this myself, I felt that one day when I I am ready for it, I would like to accompany others and help them on this journey. A lot of self-awareness and inner work was and is constantly connected to all of this.
I obtained the international yoga instructor certificate on January 23, 2021, at the "Asram" Yoga Instructor Academy, under the leadership of Erika Dalma Nagy, a yogi who lived and studied in India, and an international yoga instructor. However, I did not feel that I was ready, so I continued my studies.I obtained many more diplomas and gained experience abroad... :))
Life made it so that in the spring of 2024 I started to work publicly as an educator, healer, and helper.
